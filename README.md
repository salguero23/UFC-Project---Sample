# UFC Webscraping Project - Sample


The main purpose of this repo is to display a webscarper I built designed to webscrape the UFC Stats page. Attached to this repo is a PyNotebook designed to cluster fighters based on four styles; grappling, striking, wrestling, and for fighters who are well rounded. With this new data we build a Logistic Regression designed to measure the signifigance of fighting style, striking, submission, and takedown attempts.
