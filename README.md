# UFC Webscraping Project - Sample


The main purpose of this repo is to display a tool I built designed to webscrape the UFC Stats page. Attached to this repo is a PyNotebook that I use to cluster fighters based on four styles; grappling, striking, wrestling, and for fighters who are well rounded. With this new data we build a Logistic Regression to measure the signifigance of each fighting style & striking, submission, and takedown attempts.

A simple interactive plot for striking metrics can be found at:
